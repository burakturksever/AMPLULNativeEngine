# AMPLULNativeEngine (Discontinued)
## A Metaprogramming Language to Unify Languages - Native Engine
This repository includes a functional engine that can run Python, C and Java code directly inside Python.
This proof of concept will be implemented into the AMPLUL project.
## Dependencies
- Python3
- GCC
- Java Development Kit
## Test Drive
To test drive this engine, you can edit the code segments within the main.py file to your desire.
Whatever code written **must** print out the desired output. Multiple print statements will automatically set the output type to str.
After doing so, use the `python3 main.py` command within the AMPLULNativeEngine directory to run the program.
## Limitations
Can only run on Linux machines properly
